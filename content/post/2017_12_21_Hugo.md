# Technology behind my Blog

To create this Blog I am using [hugo](https://www.gohugo.io).  My familiarity with hugo comes with being a contributor for our [workshop site](https://redhatgov.github.io) at work.

I went with hugo so I can have better control of my blog rather than going with a blogging platform.  Also, I'm going to be posting code snippets.  And when I looked into using wordpress, it looks like they charge to use modules where you can post code snippets.  Using hugo short codes are free.  I am also using github pages to host this blog.  So again free.  One thing you'll notice from my blogs is that I don't like paying for things when I can do it myself.

I also like hugo because it allows me to use markdown to create my site.  And also I can reuse short codes created from other people.  I'll use this post to paste some of my favorite shortcodes.


## Examples of shortcodes

#### Code Snippets

```bash

$ Insert Code Here

```

#### Insert Images

<img src="../../images/hugo-logo2.png" width="70" /><br/><br/>

#### Alerts

{{% alert info %}}

 This is ``<Insert Text>`` I want to highlight

{{% /alert %}}

<br>
#### And many others....
