Yesterday, I decided to finally stop my Verizon Triple play and cut the cord on TV and a Phone line.  I had 100 / 100 mbps internet and I upped it to 1 gbs internet.  By cutting the TV and Internet, I'm saving about $70-80 a month.  

I was a little worried that I would not get the advertised 940 / 800 mbps speed (I know, it's not true gigabit speeed, but more than enough.) because my house is wired with Cat 5 Ethernet.  And from what I read from read online, many said that Cat 5 is not meant for 1 gbs, but Cat 5E is.  And then I read that Cat 5 and Cat 5E are not much different.  Well, I am here to tell you that Cat 5 gives me that advertised 940 / 880 speed.

My router works best in the middle of my house, but the FIOS comes in from the basement.  I previously was using the existing COAX to place my router in the middle of my house with 100 / 100 mbps speed.  But FIOS requires ethernet for the gigabit connection.  So I actually purchased, but returned the [Actiontec Bonded MOCA 2.0 Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Actiontec-Bonded-Ethernet-Adapter-ECB6200K02/dp/B013J7O3X0) to place the router in the middle floor of my house.  From what I read, you can get gigabit speed through your existing coax with the adapter.  But since I"m using ethernet, it's not needed.

I already have a Netflix and Amazon Prime account.  So I purchased a [Roku Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Ultra-streaming-Enhanced-headphone/dp/B075XMZMWY/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1515090984&sr=1-3&keywords=roku+ultra) to use as my main entertainment box for my tv.

I'm also considering an [Orbi](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Orbi-Whole-System-Tri-band/dp/B01K4CZOBS/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1515091085&sr=1-2&keywords=orbi) and a TV service.  It looks like [Hulu Live TV](https://www.hulu.com/live-tv) maybe the way to go for me based on the channels I watch.
